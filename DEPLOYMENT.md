# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

Your React portfolio is now configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages! Follow these steps to enable hosting.

## 📋 Prerequisites Completed ✅

- ✅ React portfolio converted and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Package.json configured with homepage URL and deploy scripts
- ✅ Build process tested and working
- ✅ Image paths configured for GitHub Pages

## 🔧 Enable GitHub Pages (Required Steps)

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Rajput-Vivek-16/Portfolio`
2. Click on **Settings** tab (at the top of the repository)

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
2. Click on **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (instead of Deploy from a branch)
4. Save the settings

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Actions (if needed)
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. If prompted, click **Enable GitHub Actions**
3. The workflow should automatically run when you push to main branch

## 🌐 Your Portfolio URLs

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, your portfolio will be available at:
- **Main URL**: `https://rajput-vivek-16.github.io/Portfolio`
- **Custom Domain**: You can optionally set up a custom domain later

## 📈 Automatic Deployment Process

Your portfolio will automatically deploy when you:
1. Push changes to the `main` branch
2. Create a pull request to `main` branch

The GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. ✅ Install dependencies
2. ✅ Build the React app
3. ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. ✅ Update your live website

## 🔍 Check Deployment Status

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You'll see deployment workflows running
3. Green checkmark = successful deployment
4. Red X = deployment failed (check logs)

## 🛠️ Local Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (manual)
npm run deploy
```

## 🎯 Next Steps After GitHub Pages is Enabled

1. **Test Your Live Site**: Visit `https://rajput-vivek-16.github.io/Portfolio`
2. **Make Updates**: Edit any component and push to see automatic deployment
3. **Custom Domain** (optional): Add your own domain in GitHub Pages settings
4. **SEO Optimization**: Add meta tags, sitemap, etc.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check **Actions** tab for error logs
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" source
3. Verify repository has **Pages** feature enabled

### If images don't load:
- Images are configured to use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`
- Make sure images are in the `public/` folder

### If styles look broken:
- Check that homepage URL in package.json matches your GitHub Pages URL
- Clear browser cache and refresh
